description: "The Way We Live Now is a satirical novel by Anthony Trollope, published\
  \ in London in 1875 after first appearing in serialised form. It is one of the last\
  \ significant Victorian novels to have been published in monthly parts.\nComprising\
  \ 100 chapters, The Way We Live Now was Trollope's longest novel, and is particularly\
  \ rich in sub-plot. It was inspired by the financial scandals of the early 1870s;\
  \ Trollope had just returned to England from abroad, and was appalled by the greed\
  \ and dishonesty those scandals exposed. This novel was his rebuke. It dramatises\
  \ how that greed and dishonesty pervaded the commercial, political, moral, and intellectual\
  \ life of that era.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
